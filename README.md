- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @grontis

I spend most of my day working as a backend .NET developer, and am currently working on improving my front end skills in React and Angular with hopes of moving towards a full stack skillset.

I also spend time playing around with game development in my free time and hope to finish a game project eventually. Similar to my work experience, my knowledge in game development is strongest around writing back end code, but I am trying to learn 3D modeling in blender and UI design.

Hoping to also continue using Go for personal projects and tools as I go.
